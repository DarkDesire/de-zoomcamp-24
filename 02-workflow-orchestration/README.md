# Week 2: Workflow Orchestration

Welcome to Week 2 of the Data Engineering Zoomcamp! 🚀😤 This week, we'll be covering workflow orchestration with Mage.

Mage is an open-source, hybrid framework for transforming and integrating data. ✨

This week, you'll learn how to use the Mage platform to author and share _magical_ data pipelines. This will all be covered in the course, but if you'd like to learn a bit more about Mage, check out our docs [here](https://docs.mage.ai/introduction/overview).

## 📕 Course Resources

### 2.2.1 - 📯 Intro to Orchestration

In this section, we'll cover the basics of workflow orchestration. We'll discuss what it is, why it's important, and how it can be used to build data pipelines.

### 2.2.2 - 🧙‍♂️ Intro to Mage

In this section, we'll introduce the Mage platform. We'll cover what makes Mage different from other orchestrators, the fundamental concepts behind Mage, and how to get started. To cap it off, we'll spin Mage up via Docker 🐳 and run a simple pipeline.

### 2.2.3 - 🐘 ETL: API to Postgres

Hooray! Mage is up and running. Now, let's build a _real_ pipeline. In this section, we'll build a simple ETL pipeline that loads data from an API into a Postgres database. Our database will be built using Docker— it will be running locally, but it's the same as if it were running in the cloud.
